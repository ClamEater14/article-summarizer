# Article Summarizer (Frontend)

This is the frontend, made using TypeScript and React (with Vite).

## Running the Frontend

```
cd ./frontend
```
2. Run the following to install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Run the following to start the frontend:
```
npm run dev
```
4. Wait until you see the output showing something like the following before accessing the `Local` link on your browser:
```
VITE v4.3.9  ready in 2841 ms

➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h to show help
```
5. Press `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop the frontend.
